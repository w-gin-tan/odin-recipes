    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>A scallion pancake is the Chinese version of the classic American breakfast. 
       This pancake is crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and wonderfully savory all over.
       If youâ€™re looking for a new twist on your regular pancakes, this is the recipe for you.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>For the dough:</h3>
        <li>300g (10.5 oz) of all-purpose flour use</li>
        <li>210ml (0.9 cup/7oz) of warm water</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>

        <h3>For the roux:</h3>
        <li>2 tbsp of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>60ml (1/4 cup) of vegetable oil</li>

        <h3>For the sauce:</h3>
        <li>4 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp black vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp chopped spring onions</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili oil <em>(Optional)</em></li>

        <h3>Others:</h3>
        <li>Some chopped green onion (about 3-4 stalks)</li>
        <li>Salt to sprinkle on the dough</li>
    </ul>   
    
    <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine dough ingredients in a mixing bowl. Mix well with a spatula. </li>
        <li>Continue mixing (or with an electric mixer with the dough hook attached) until it is smooth and stay free from the bowl. Cover and rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix roux ingredients in a small saucepan. Heat until the oil starts boiling to form the roux. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into four. Roll each portion thinly into a long rectangle.</li>
        <li>Apply the roux on the surface but leave about one cm free from the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the salt and spring onion from the other ingredients on the surface.</li>
        <li>Roll up the dough like making a Swiss roll. Roll and stretch the dough to form a long rope.</li>
        <li>Coil the rope to form a round dough.</li>
        <li>Roll out to about 1/4 inch thick circle. Pan-fried over medium heat until it has charred lines and speckled spots.</li>
        <li>Flip over and cover the pan for one minute. Remove the cover and continue pan-frying until both sides are golden brown. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Combine all sauce ingredients in a sauce bowl.</li>
    </ol>
